# HISTORY.md — riir-infer

Durable records for resolved questions and closed lanes (the noise-reduction
convention: the record lands here, hash-pinned; open work lives in `.issues/`
and `.plans/`). Created 2026-09-23 at the first record.

## 2026-09-23 — crates.io publication: keep `publish = false` until the vendor patches upstream (owner-gates menu v2 row 2)

Owner verdict: the crate and `crates/riir-infer-gpu` stay **closed to
crates.io** — this is a HARD blocker, not a preference. Both vendor forks under
`vendor/` are load-bearing (`[patch.crates-io]` in the root manifest):

- `cubecl-runtime` — carries the #1359 drop-queue fix.
- `wgpu-hal` — carries the VRAM accessors the GPU code probes.

A `[patch.crates-io]` section does not survive publication: a crates.io
consumer would build against the UNPATCHED upstream crates — the drop-queue bug
and the missing accessors included. Publication becomes available the day the
vendor deltas land upstream (the forks shrink to zero and the patches drop out
of the manifest).

Boundary note: this repo stays upstream of the engine regardless — the public
funnel for the stack's primitives remains `katgpt-rs` (its katgpt-core family
publishes), not this repo.
